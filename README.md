# tríggir

_Tríggir_ is [Faroese](http://visitfaroeislands.com) for three. This is a starter template for a [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) project, using webpack, with some useful default classes and helpers. Mostly made this for my personal use, and is very much a __work in progress__.
